    "Currently, there are no disease-modifying (or curing) agents for dementia. For context as to why this is an important question to look at, is that there’s evidence that prevalence of dementia in high-income countries is declining but we aren’t seeing that downward trend in many places around the world. There’s also evidence that partaking in certain daily lifestyle activities that continue to optimize cognitive function as you age is known to help prevent the onset of dementia. It is also important to tailor prevention programs to local context and risk factors. With an expansion on this kind of research, we can design effective interventions and ultimately it will lead to more appropriate public health policies regarding healthy aging. "

    "Lastly, I want to touch on a few things I’ve learned so far throughout this project. The first is just understanding the modeling process, and more importantly the interpretation of various results, when I’m dealing with both categorical predictors and a categorical outcome variable. My predictor model thus far produces low predictive accuracy scores and so I’m trying to distinguish between ‘have I done something wrong in terms of proper representation’ or ‘should this be interpreted as maybe dementia onset is more random than I’ve tried to predict it as’. Is dementia as an outcome just something that develops quite drastically in a wide range of individuals. So again, that “bad” predictive accuracy may be quite informative, I just am learning how to interpret that appropriately as I continue on with the machine learning stage of the project."
